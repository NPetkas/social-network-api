# social-network-api

## Description

  Social Network Api was built to simulate how a real world back-end social network database will act with 
  functionalities such as adding friends, thought creation/deletion, and reaction creation/deletion. For reference, this build 
  demonstrates how to setup model requirements with a numerical count, setting up MongoDB with Mongoose, standard controllers, creation of multiple routes, and the 
  use of 3rd party application `Insomnia` to test route requests.
